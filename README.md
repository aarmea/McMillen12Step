McMillen Instruments 12 Step for Ableton Live
=============================================

An __unofficial__ script to make using the McMillen Instruments 12 Step with
Ableton Live a little easier. _Caveat emptor._

Setup
-----

0. Connect your 12 Step and install the drivers.

1. Clone this repository into the Ableton MIDI Remote Scripts directory.

  * Windows: `%LIVE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY%\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts`
  * Mac: `$LIVE_APP_PACKAGE.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts`

2. Open Ableton Live.

3. In [Live preferences]/MIDI Sync, in a "None" row, change the control surface
   to "McMillen12Step" and the input to "12Step (Port 1)". Slightly below, under
   "MIDI Ports", find "McMillen12Step Input..." and only turn on Remote.
